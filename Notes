Just for Containerization

Ways to pass Env Vars at runtime

1. --env arguements for each environment variable.
2. --env-file to read a file of env vars

Way 2 is preferred. Docs needed for how to do this. Unsure if a small cli should
be built. The cli could potentially create the plex_envs file, pull the Docker
container, and run the container with the proper arguments.

Scheduling Emails

Original idea was to just have the user manage it how they saw fit. Since it is
now a containerized implementation that doesn't work. Something has to be passed
to the container at runtime that reads the PLEX_DAYS_PASSED env var, adds 1 and
sets up some type of schedule for the command.
